The goal was to create a script / robot that could go through the "maze" without hitting any of the walls unnecessarily.  
We recorded a video to show off the results: https://youtu.be/DAMvCsfZ8Ag

The robot has two large motors that are used in the standard build to operate the wheels. We have another medium motor that was used to operate an arm, but was unhooked and disabled for this challenge. The two touch sensors are independent, although are activated in tandem typically. They are held together using a small barier, so that when any side or angle is pressed, one of the sensors will activate, forcing the script to proceed to the next loop.
