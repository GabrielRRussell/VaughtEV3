Lego Mindstorm's EV3 challenges for Mr. Vaughts 18/19 Intro Class, Period 3

These are a collection of various programs made for our Lego Mindstorms bots. The goals were varied, but most of them were confined in a maze and were designed to show off skill in using various sensors, maths, and troubleshooting. All of them were performed autonomously, meaning without human input. We were given limited hardware, and had to design around it. The first two were done knowing the path of the maze, and the later ones had to be coded so that the bot wouldn't go down a pre-programmed track.

Among the challenges were...

1. Navigate the Maze by using a touch sensor to find out which wall we had touched
2. Navigate the Maze by using an ultrasonic sensor to find out how close we were to a wall, and to go around the maze without touching a single wall.
3. Navigate the Maze by using a color sensor to take turns that were marked using various colors.
4. Navigate the Maze by using a color sensor to follow a pattern drawn in the maze.
5. Follow a Race Track as fast as possible, taking proper turns without exiting the course.

Outside of class mandated assignments, I did my own experimentation. I used bluetooth to communicate messages with one robot, and had the messages translated to movements in another robot. Essentially you could remotely control a robot. I had programmed in motor functionality, including a fully controllable speed setting, akin to holding down a gas pedal. I planned on programming in a feature that would let the robot transmit sensors input on it, but we ran out of time before I could finish it.
